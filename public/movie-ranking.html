<h1>Movie Recommendations from Josh</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Series of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>#1 Peaky Blinders</h3>
<p>Awesome series with great characters and a great story line (RIP John).</p>
<h3>#2 Final Space</h3>
<p>Good series for when your spaced wanting to watch something about space.</p>
<h3>#3 F1 Drive to Survive</h3>
<p>Found this very easy watching, admittedly I enjoyed the first seasons more than the latter but still good.</p>
